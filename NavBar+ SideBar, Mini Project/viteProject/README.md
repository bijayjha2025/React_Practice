# React + Vite      # Navbar + Sidebar Layout
This is a small React project I built to practice and strengthen the skills I've learned so far in React. It's a simple UI layout with a Navbar and Sidebar, where I experimented with components, state, event handling, and other React concepts.

What I Learned / Practiced
React Components: Breaking the UI into reusable and manageable components.
State Management: Using useState to handle inputs, toggles, and interactions.
Event Handling: Handling clicks, input changes, and other user actions.
Props Passing: Sending data between parent and child components.
Project Structure: Organizing folders and files in a clean, maintainable way.
Vite Setup: Using Vite as the development environment for fast builds and easy setup.

Features
Simple Navbar and Sidebar layout
Basic input handling and event interactions
Clean folder structure demonstrating component-based architecture

Install dependencies: npm install
Run the project: npm run dev

Notes
This project is simple and not meant to be a full product — the main goal was practice and learning.
I wanted to challenge myself to use all the concepts I’ve learned in React up to this point.
