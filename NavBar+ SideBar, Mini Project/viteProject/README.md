# React + Vite      # Navbar + Sidebar Layout
This is a small React project I built to practice and strengthen the skills I've learned so far in React. It's a simple UI layout with a Navbar and Sidebar, where I experimented with components, state, event handling, and other React concepts.

What I Learned / Practiced
1. React Components: Breaking the UI into reusable and manageable components.
2. State Management: Using useState to handle inputs, toggles, and interactions.
3. Event Handling: Handling clicks, input changes, and other user actions.
4. Props Passing: Sending data between parent and child components.
5. Project Structure: Organizing folders and files in a clean, maintainable way.
6. Vite Setup: Using Vite as the development environment for fast builds and easy setup.

Features
1. Simple Navbar and Sidebar layout
2. Basic input handling and event interactions
3. Clean folder structure demonstrating component-based architecture

Notes
This project is simple and not meant to be a full product — the main goal was practice and learning.
I wanted to challenge myself to use all the concepts I’ve learned in React up to this point.
