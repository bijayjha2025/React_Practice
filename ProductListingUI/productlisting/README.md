# React + Vite

# Product Listing UI
A small and simple React project I built to practice the core fundamentals of React. It helped me understand React by actually building something.

What I Learned
Rendering dynamic lists using .map()
Conditional rendering using if, &&, and ternary operators
Managing component state with useState
Search filtering with controlled inputs
Category filtering
Breaking UI into reusable components
Adding basic animations for a nicer feel

Features I Implemented
Search products by name
Filter by category
Display available/unavailable products
Clean product card UI
Smooth entrance animations

Why I Built This
I wanted a small, practical project to strengthen my React fundamentals without jumping into advanced topics. It made React feel clearer and more natural.
